# Library-System
This python program provides interfaces that allow users to manage books, ratings, and users in the library for a more convinient and easier library management.

To initialize the program, 

1. Either download the Archieve.zip and uncompress, or directly download the other six files.

2. Run main.py

3. After entering the program, the interface would suggest eleven options. In order to initialize the program, type numbers and return for selecting different options. Try the first two options before testing since they are necessary inputs for the program. Those two options would read books.txt and ratings.txt.

#4. Two .txt documents are examples to test the performence of the program. Feel free to use them. They could be replaced but have to be in the same format for running the program.

#5. Option 10 is left for everyone to make suggestions, so it is an empty option for now.
